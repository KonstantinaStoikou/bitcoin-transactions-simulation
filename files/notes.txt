NOTES

- what exactly does memcpy do?
- transaction key change in function
- better hash functions
- change hashtable sizes
- pointers to structs vs ids for hashing (maybe pointers)
- hashtable for sender, receiver and store transactions file data
- make input validity checks (for prompts)
- check if unique bitcoins ids, user ids and transaction ids
- make function to make transaction (request) and maybe call it when reading file also
- drop only invalid transaction (not exiting program)\
- better error messages, use perror for error messages without variables
- maybe change some pointers to pointer to single pointer
- maybe better project structure
