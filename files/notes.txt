NOTES

- check if files work from all possible directories
- better hash functions
- change hashtable sizes
- make input validity checks (for prompts)
- check if command line arguments work
- check if all double pointer are useful (for by reference passing)
- check when tree node amount is 0
- check node not found
- maybe i dont need sprintf with "./" for files
