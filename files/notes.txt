NOTES

- delete tree
- better hash functions
- change hashtable sizes
- pointers to structs vs ids for hashing (maybe pointer)
- bitcoin id is int?
- memcpy in list
- 2 hashtable is data duplication?
- hashtable for sender, receiver and store transactions file data
- make input validity checks (for prompts)
- hashtable to store transaction ids only for reading file and then delete it
- check if unique bitcoins ids, user ids and transaction ids
