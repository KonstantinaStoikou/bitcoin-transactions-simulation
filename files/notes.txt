NOTES

- tree split policy
- what exactly does memcpy do?
- transaction key change in function
- better hash functions
- change hashtable sizes
- pointers to structs vs ids for hashing (maybe pointers)
- make input validity checks (for prompts)
- check if unique bitcoins ids, user ids and transaction ids
- better error messages, use perror for error messages without variables
- maybe better project structure
